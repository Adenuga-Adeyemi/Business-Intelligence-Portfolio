# Business Intelligence Portfolio

Welcome to my Business Intelligence Portfolioâ€”a home for my collection of data projects built using Power BI, Excel, SQL, Python, and more. These projects showcase my experience in building dashboards, analyzing data, and communicating insights across different industries, including retail, healthcare, education, and tech.

Each folder in this repo contains a separate project, complete with documentation, datasets (when shareable), visuals, and Power BI files.
